        <p>This project is something I coded using Python.  My goal was to have gears that rotate at different speeds to make it look realistic.  It took a lot of trial and error, but I was eventually able to perfect the movement of the gears.  I ultimately learned how to animate pictures to make them look more interesting.</p>

        <p>This project is a lantern I coded using Python.  My goal was to use different shapes and gradients to create a picture of an illuminated lantern.  I accomplished my goal by using a bunch of different shapes and creative thinking.  I learned how to use different shapes, borders, and lines to create a picture.</p>

        <p>This project was a practice create task me and my friend Arman made on Snap! It is a cool Build-A-Car Simuluator, where you can add various sports car colors and items such as a spoiler and whatnot. It was made for the Congressional App Challenge.</p>

        <h2>AP Create Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://replit.com/@RohanJadhav8/blackjack-start#main.py">Blackjack</a></p>
        <p>This was the main Create Task that me and my partner Daniel made for the AP CSP Exam. It is a Blackjack game, where a user can select to yes or no to play the game, in which a random number generator is used to draw 2 random cards for you and a computer. The cards are then compared to see which one has a sum of cards closer to 21. You can also choose to draw more cards to add complexity to the game. It was really fun to make in Python, and I hope to code like this more in the future.</p>
